"Preset_Notes=This is a generic contact mode biofeedback preset for GeneratorX. It is almost identical to the General Biofeedback Scan, but will perform a Baseline before running a single scan.

An accidental discovery revealed that performing a Baseline immediately before a scan improves the results by an order of magnitude.Baseline is a method of removing all electrical noise from the signal. This preset performs this automatically.

GeneratorX can perform biofeedback scans much quicker than Spooky Pulse. There are two reasons:

1. GeneratorX is detecting electrical signals which travel very fast.

2. The response detected is a measurement of the electrical signals and does not rely on a physiological response like a heart beat or perspiration.

Unlike other biofeedback methods, GeneratorX does not need the contact pads far apart. In fact, it is better to have them very close together.

If the TENS pads are far apart (like we recommend for Spooky Pulse) the ratio of bad cells to good cells between the pads is reduced. If you have cancer in your lungs, placing the TENS pads on your right wrist and left ankle will mean that most of the distance between the pads is healthy tissue. The hits detected will be hidden by the 'noise' of the good cells.

It is like trying to listen to music while having children playing nearby. It is better to be close to the music player so the sound is clearer. So we recommend that the TENS pads be placed as close as possible to the problem area.

There is no limit to how close you can place the TENS pads. There are instances where you can have them 1mm (0.04 inches) apart. In fact, the accuracy of the results become greater the closer you have them.

If you only have bad cells between the pads, the results will be pure and super-accurate. There are fewer good cells to add unwanted signals to the results.

Before commencing the scan, enter text in the Log Name field in the Control tab. This can be a person's name or other relevant information. The file created will use this text, making record keeping easier later.

Do NOT use Spooky Boost with this preset. The signal is more pure if the TENS pads are connected directly to the generator output port.

For more information on biofeedback scanning, please see the section on Biofeedback Scan in the latest Spooky2 User's Guide."
