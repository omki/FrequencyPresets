"Preset_Notes=This Grade Scan Shell preset contains settings that allow you to test any database or third-party program for effectiveness against your condition. There are no programs listed to the left because you must choose and load the program you wish to test.

IMPORTANT: you should use this preset with programs for pathogens or pathogenic diseases because only living organisms can mutate and change their mortal frequencies. Programs for healing, organ/system support, or detox should not be used because frequencies for these purposes are fixed and immutable, and are used differently by the body anyway in a process called entrainment.

This scan can be administered in Contact Mode (recommended where possible), or by using Sample Digitizer. You cannot do it in Plasma Mode because of the sensitive measuring electronics within GX.

When the scan is done, it will present the original frequencies rearranged in order of their effectiveness for you, with the most useful at the top. The hits do NOT mean you have the condition. It only ranks the frequencies you have loaded. You're free to save the program as it is, or to use the checkboxes to omit the least effective frequencies.

For important details on biofeedback scanning, please see the section on Biofeedback Scan in the latest Spooky2 User's Guide.

1. GeneratorX is detecting electrical signals which travel very fast.

2. The response detected is a measurement of the electrical signals and does not rely on a physiological response like a heart beat or perspiration.

Unlike other biofeedback methods, GeneratorX does not need the contact pads far apart. In fact, it is better to have them very close together.

If the TENS pads are far apart (like we recommend for Spooky Pulse) the ratio of bad cells to good cells between the pads is reduced. If you have cancer in your lungs, placing the TENS pads on your right wrist and left ankle will mean that most of the distance between the pads is healthy tissue. The hits detected will be hidden by the 'noise' of the good cells.

It is like trying to listen to music while having children playing nearby. It is better to be close to the music player so the sound is clearer. So we recommend that the TENS pads be placed as close as possible to the problem area.

There is no limit to how close you can place the TENS pads. There are instances where you can have them 1mm (0.04 inches) apart. In fact, the accuracy of the results become greater the closer you have them.

If you only have bad cells between the pads, the results will be pure and super-accurate. There are fewer good cells to add unwanted signals to the results.

Before commencing the scan, enter text in the Log Name field in the Control tab. This can be a person's name or other relevant information. The file created will use this text, making record keeping easier later.

Do NOT use Spooky Boost with this preset. The signal is more pure if the TENS pads are connected directly to the generator output port.
