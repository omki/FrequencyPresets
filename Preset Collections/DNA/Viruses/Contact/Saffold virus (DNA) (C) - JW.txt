"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Saffold virus.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Saffold virus isolate SAFV-3_NL1999-590|Saffold virus isolate SAFV-3_NL2007-2686|Saffold virus isolate SAFV-3_NL2005-1035|Saffold virus isolate SAFV-3_NL2007-2690|Saffold virus polyprotein|Saffold virus strain BCH1031|Saffold virus isolate SAFV-3-Maynas-Loreto-Peru-2012|Saffold virus strain Can112051-06 adapted|Saffold virus strain Penang|Saffold virus strain JPN08-404|Saffold virus||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
