"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Hepatitis D.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Hepatitis D Virus|Hepatitis D virus isolate TW2479-53|Hepatitis D virus from Canada|Hepatitis D virus genomic RNA, isolate:VnzD8375|Hepatitis D virus genomic RNA, isolate:VnzD8349|Hepatitis D virus strain TW2667|Hepatitis D virus DNA, strain:Miyako(JA-M13)|Hepatitis D virus DNA, strain:Miyako(JA-M4)|Hepatitis D virus isolate TW2479-12s|Hepatitis D virus isolate TW2479-18|Hepatitis D virus isolate TW2479-13|Hepatitis D virus strain TW2476|Hepatitis D virus genomic RNA, isolate:VnzD8624|Hepatitis D virus isolate TWD2577-66 genotype I|Hepatitis D virus containing delta antigen ORF|Hepatitis D virus isolate TWD2476-38 genotype IIa||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
