"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Variegated squirrel bornavirus.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH12/16|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH21/16|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH22/16-16|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH22/16-34|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH22/16-35|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH22/16-36|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH22/16-37|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH22/16-38|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_122-15-1 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_122-15-2 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_133-15 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_3-16-1 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_3-16-2 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_48-15-1 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_48-15-11 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_48-15-2 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_49-15-1 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_49-15-6 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 isolate BH_75-15 genome assembly: monopartite|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 strain VSBV-1/BH55/16|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1, isolate patient 3 brain|Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1, isolate squirrel brain||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
