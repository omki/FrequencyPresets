"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for St. Louis encephalitis virus.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|St. Louis encephalitis virus isolate 2281|St. Louis encephalitis virus isolate 39|St. Louis encephalitis virus isolate 43|St. Louis encephalitis virus isolate BeH355964|St. Louis encephalitis virus strain Palenque-C475|St. Louis encephalitis virus strain 79V-2533|St. Louis encephalitis virus strain CbaAr-4005|St. Louis encephalitis virus strain Palenque-A770|St. Louis encephalitis virus isolate Imperial Valley|St. Louis encephalitis virus strain Hubbard|St. Louis encephalitis virus strain Kern217||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
