"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Echovirus 2.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Human echovirus 2 strain Cornelis|Human echovirus 20 strain JV-1|Human echovirus 27 strain Bacon|Human echovirus 25 strain HN-2|Human echovirus 26 strain Coronel|Human echovirus 21 strain Farina|Human echovirus 25 strain JV-4|Human echovirus 29 strain JV-10|Human echovirus 24 strain DeCamp|Human parechovirus 2 isolate 51Chzj674||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
