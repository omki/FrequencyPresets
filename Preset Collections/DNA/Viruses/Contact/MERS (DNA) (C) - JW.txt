"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for MERS.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Burkina Faso/CIRAD-HKU697/2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Morocco/CIRAD-HKU213/2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Burkina Faso/CIRAD-HKU434/2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NV1405/2016|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NV1712/2016|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NV1989/2016|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NV2040/2016|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NV1657/2016|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NV1673/2016|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NV1787/2016|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NV2020/2016|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Nigeria/NS004/2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Burkina Faso/CIRAD-HKU785/2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/THA/CU/17_06_2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV-Jeddah-Camel-1|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV-Jeddah-human-1|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/001_05_2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Kenya/C1215/2018|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Kenya/C1272/2018|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Ethiopia/AAU-EPHI-HKU4412/2017|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Ethiopia/AAU-EPHI-HKU4448/2017|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus strain MERS-CoV_England-KSA/1/2018(sputum)|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/Seoul/077-2-2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV camel/Ethiopia/AAU-EPHI-HKU4458/2017|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/Seoul/162-1-2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate Merscov/Egypt/Camel/AHRI-FAO-1/2018|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/Seoul/169-2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/Seoul/050-1-2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/Seoul/066-2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/Seoul/080-3-2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/Seoul/177-3-2015|Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus isolate MERS-CoV/KOR/KCDC/001_2018-TSVi|Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, isolate Mersin 1||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
