"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for HBV recombinant.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HBV recombinant C/G DNA, isolate: NAB46|HBV recombinant B/C DNA, isolate: NAB20|HBV recombinant A/E 18142-BUR DNA|HBV recombinant A/E 18311-BUR DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C170329 DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C170337 DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C170405 DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C172562 DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C174334c DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C174335m DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C174347c DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C174348m DNA|HBV recombinant B/C C171367 DNA||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
