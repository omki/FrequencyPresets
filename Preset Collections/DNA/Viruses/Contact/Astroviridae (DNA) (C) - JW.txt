"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Astroviridae.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Astroviridae sp. isolate tom152ast2|Astroviridae sp. isolate spa143ast1|Astroviridae sp. isolate sru051ast1|Astroviridae sp. isolate ybw202ast01|Astroviridae sp. isolate ybb150ast01|Astroviridae sp. isolate war204ast1|Astroviridae sp. isolate stc111ast1|Astroviridae sp. isolate ytb089ast01|Astroviridae sp. isolate tom152ast1|Astroviridae sp. isolate ytb090ast01||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
