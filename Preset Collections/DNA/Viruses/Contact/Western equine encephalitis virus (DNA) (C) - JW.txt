"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Western equine encephalitis virus.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Western equine encephalitis virus strain PV02808A|Western equine encephalitis virus strain PV72102|Western equine encephalitis virus strain R0PV00384A|Western equine encephalitis virus strain 93A79|Western equine encephalitis virus strain R02PV002957B|Western equine encephalitis virus strain TBT-235|Western equine encephalitis virus strain R02PV003422B|Western equine encephalitis virus strain Lake43|Western equine encephalitis virus strain 75V9291|Western equine encephalitis virus strain 93A38|Western equine encephalitis virus strain BFS1703|Western equine encephalitis virus strain CHLV53|Western equine encephalitis virus strain CO921356|Western equine encephalitis virus strain EP-6|Western equine encephalitis virus strain BFS09997|Western equine encephalitis virus strain BFS3060|Western equine encephalitis virus strain E1416|Western equine encephalitis virus strain IMPR441|Western equine encephalitis virus strain R02PV001807A|Western equine encephalitis virus strain S8-122|Western equine encephalitis virus strain 93A27|Western equine encephalitis virus strain 93A30|Western equine encephalitis virus strain CNTR34|Western equine encephalitis virus strain California|Western equine encephalitis virus strain BFS932|Western equine encephalitis virus strain Fleming||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
