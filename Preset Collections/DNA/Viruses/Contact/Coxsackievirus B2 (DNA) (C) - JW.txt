"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Coxsackievirus B2.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Coxsackievirus B2 isolate NSW-V06-2008-CVB2|Coxsackievirus B2 isolate NSW-V16-2005-CVB2|Coxsackievirus B2 isolate NSW-V17-2006-CVB2|Coxsackievirus B2 isolate NSW-V29-2008-CVB2|Coxsackievirus B2 isolate NSW-V42-2008-CVB2|Coxsackievirus B2 isolate NSW-V52-2008-CVB2|Coxsackievirus B2 isolate NSW-V53-2010-CVB2|Coxsackievirus B2 strain 13-2380-2_B2|Coxsackievirus B2 strain Ohio|Coxsackievirus B2 strain RW41-2/YN/CHN/2012|Human coxsackievirus B2 isolate KOR 04-243|Human coxsackievirus B2 isolate KOR 04-279||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
