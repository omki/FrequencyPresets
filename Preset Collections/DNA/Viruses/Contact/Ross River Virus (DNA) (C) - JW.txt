"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Ross River Virus.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Ross River virus (RRV) (strain NB5092) RNA|Ross River virus|Ross River virus isolate Ross River Virus/H.sapiens-wt/Australia/1972/14389|Ross River virus isolate Ross River Virus/A.vigilax-tc/Australia/1959/T48|Ross River virus strain 9057|Ross River virus strain 8961|Ross River virus isolate RRV_TT|Ross River virus strain 2982|Ross River virus strain 3078|Ross River virus strain 2975|Ross River virus strain T48|Ross River virus isolate MIDI86.2018|Ross River virus isolate MIDI13.2016|Ross River virus strain QML 1|Ross River virus isolate MIDI32.2017|Ross River virus isolate Ross River Virus/H.sapiens-wt/Australia/2009/PW14||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
