"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Murray Valley encephalitis virus.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate VIDRL|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate OR156-C10|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate OR156-CD8|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate OR156-D10|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate OR156-P0|Murray Valley encephalitis virus strain OR156|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate V11-10|Murray Valley encephalitis virus strain NG156|Murray Valley encephalitis virus strain VIDRL_MVE_070418|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate Canada/human/2011|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate MVE-1-51-C10|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate MVE-1-51-CD8|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate MVE-1-51-D10|Murray Valley encephalitis virus isolate MVE-1-51-P0|Murray Valley encephalitis virus strain MK6684|Murray Valley encephalitis virus strain MVE-1-51|Murray Valley encephalitis virus||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
