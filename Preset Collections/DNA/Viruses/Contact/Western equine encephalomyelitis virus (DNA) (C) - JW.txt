"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Western equine encephalomyelitis virus.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus isolate 71V1658|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus isolate BFS-2005|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus isolate Montana-64|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus isolate 85-452NM|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus isolate Imperial|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus isolate Kern|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus isolate McMillan|Western equine encephalomyelitis virus isolate AG80-646||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
