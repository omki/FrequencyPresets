"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data for Bartonella tribocorum.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Bartonella tribocorum plasmid BM1374166, strain BM1374166|Bartonella tribocorum strain BM1374166 plasmid BM1374166|Bartonella tribocorum CIP 105476 plasmid pBT, type strain CIP 105476|Bartonella tribocorum CIP 105476 plasmid pBT01|Bartonella tribocorum main chromosome, strain BM1374166|Bartonella tribocorum CIP 105476|Bartonella tribocorum CIP 105476, type strain CIP 105476|Bartonella tribocorum plasmid pKM19s||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
