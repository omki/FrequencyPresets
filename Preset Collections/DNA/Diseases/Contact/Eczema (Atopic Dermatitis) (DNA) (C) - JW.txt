"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds data for pathogens linked to eczema (atopic dermatitis).||Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a condition where patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, red, cracked, and rough. Blisters may sometimes occur.||It most often begins before age 5, and may persist into adolescence and adulthood. It can flare up periodically, and then clear up for a time, even after several years.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Malassezia globosa strain CBS7966 mitochondrion|Malassezia globosa culture CBS:7966 mitochondrion|Malassezia globosa culture CBS:7874 mitochondrion|Malassezia globosa culture CBS:7990 mitochondrion|Malassezia sympodialis culture CBS:96806 mitochondrion|Malassezia sympodialis culture CBS:44340 mitochondrion|Malassezia sympodialis mycovirus isolate MsMV1||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
