"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds data for Lyme disease.||Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is an infectious disease caused by the Borrelia bacterium which is usually spread by ticks.||The most common sign of infection is an expanding area of redness on the skin, known as erythema migrans, that appears at the site of the tick bite about a week after it occurred.||Run this preset for as long as possible.
