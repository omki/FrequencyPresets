"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset contains DNA data of micro-organisms associated with macular degeneration.||Macular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), is a medical condition which may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field.||People with very advanced macular degeneration are considered legally blind. Even so, since the rest of the retina is still working, they retain their peripheral vision (or side vision).||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Cynomolgus cytomegalovirus isolate 31906|Cynomolgus cytomegalovirus isolate 31907|Cynomolgus cytomegalovirus isolate 31908|Human cytomegalovirus strain AD169|Mandrillus leucophaeus cytomegalovirus isolate OCOM6-2|Rhesus cytomegalovirus strain 68-1|UNVERIFIED_ASMBLY: Cynomolgus cytomegalovirus isolate 31909||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
