"Preset_Notes=This preset contains DNA data of micro-organisms associated with common warts.||Common warts are caused by a virus and are transmitted by touch. It can take a wart as long as two to six months to develop after your skin has been exposed to the virus. Common warts are usually harmless and eventually disappear on their own.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Human papillomavirus type 2 isolate C2|Human papillomavirus type 2 isolate CN-HB1|Human papillomavirus type 2 isolate C1|Human papillomavirus type 2 isolate CN-SC1|Human papillomavirus type 4|Human papillomavirus type 29||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote. The speeds of these frequencies are too high for the LEDs to keep up!||Connect your Spooky Remote to the 'BN' port of Spooky Boost."
