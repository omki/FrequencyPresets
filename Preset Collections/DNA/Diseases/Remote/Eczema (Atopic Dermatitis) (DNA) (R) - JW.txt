It can flare up periodically, and then clear up for a time, even after several years.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Malassezia globosa strain CBS7966 mitochondrion|Malassezia globosa culture CBS:7966 mitochondrion|Malassezia globosa culture CBS:7874 mitochondrion|Malassezia globosa culture CBS:7990 mitochondrion|Malassezia sympodialis culture CBS:96806 mitochondrion|Malassezia sympodialis culture CBS:44340 mitochondrion|Malassezia sympodialis mycovirus isolate MsMV1||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
