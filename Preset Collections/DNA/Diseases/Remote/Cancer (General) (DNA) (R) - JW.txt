"Preset_Notes=This preset holds the genome data of one micro-organism which has a major association with cancer.||In 1931, Royal Rife identified a microbe living in most, if not all, cancerous cells. He dubbed this microbe “BX”. He discovered that if you eliminate the pathogen, the body will cause cancer cells to die off and generate 'spontaneous remission.'||Rife found that this microbe has more than six forms, depending on where it was grown. Unfortunately, Rife’s research papers and laboratory equipment were destroyed, and key information was lost forever.||In 2003, a researcher discovered a microbe within cancer cells which also has multiple life forms that include short and long rods, cocci, and filamentous forms resembling a fungus. The researcher surmised that he had rediscovered BX.||This DNA preset includes the genome information of this bacteria. The frequencies from this preset match almost exactly those discovered by Royal Rife. Almost without question, BX has finally been rediscovered. The modern name for BX is bacillus licheniformis.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Bacillus licheniformis strain SCDB 14 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain PB3 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain KNU11 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain CBA7132 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580|Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13 = ATCC 14580|Bacillus licheniformis strain MCC 2514 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain SRCM103914 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain ATCC 14580 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain HRBL-15TDI7 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain ATCC 9789 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain CSL2 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain BL-010 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain SRCM103608 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain SCK B11|Bacillus licheniformis strain SRCM100027 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain 14ADL4 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain TCCC 11148 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain P8_B2 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain TAB7 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain SCCB 37|Bacillus licheniformis strain 0DA23-1 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain SRCM103583 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain SRCM103529 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain BL1202|Bacillus licheniformis strain MT-B06 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis strain SCDB 34|Bacillus licheniformis strain SRCM100141 chromosome|Bacillus licheniformis, plasmid pBL63.1|Bacillus paralicheniformis strain MDJK30 chromosome|Bacillus paralicheniformis ATCC 9945a|Bacillus paralicheniformis strain Bac84 chromosome|Bacillus paralicheniformis strain FA6 chromosome|Bacillus paralicheniformis strain Bac48 chromosome|Bacillus paralicheniformis strain CBMAI 1303 chromosome|Bacillus paralicheniformis strain 14DA11 chromosome|Bacillus paralicheniformis strain A4-3 chromosome|Bacillus paralicheniformis strain BL-09||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
