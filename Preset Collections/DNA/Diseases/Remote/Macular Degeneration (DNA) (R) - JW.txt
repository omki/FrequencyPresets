"Preset_Notes=This preset contains DNA data of micro-organisms associated with macular degeneration.||Macular degeneration, also known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), is a medical condition which may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field.||People with very advanced macular degeneration are considered legally blind. Even so, since the rest of the retina is still working, they retain their peripheral vision (or side vision).||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Cynomolgus cytomegalovirus isolate 31906|Cynomolgus cytomegalovirus isolate 31907|Cynomolgus cytomegalovirus isolate 31908|Human cytomegalovirus strain AD169|Mandrillus leucophaeus cytomegalovirus isolate OCOM6-2|Rhesus cytomegalovirus strain 68-1|UNVERIFIED_ASMBLY: Cynomolgus cytomegalovirus isolate 31909||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote. The speeds of these frequencies are too high for the LEDs to keep up!||Connect your Spooky Remote to the 'BN' port of Spooky Boost."
