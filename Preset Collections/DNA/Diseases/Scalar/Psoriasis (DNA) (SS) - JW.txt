This makes the skin build up into bumpy red patches covered with white scales. They can grow anywhere, but most appear on the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back.||Untreated psoriasis can lead to plaques that continue to build and spread. These can be quite painful, and the itching can be severe.||Run this preset for as long as possible.
