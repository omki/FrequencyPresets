"Preset_Notes=This preset contains DNA data of micro-organisms associated with Morgellons.||People with Morgellons report a crawling sensation under the skin or on the skin’s surface, rashes, and sores that have colored, thread-like filaments originating from them. Other strange particles may arise from the skin as well which look like seeds, sands, crystallized specks, or other inexplicable marks.||In 2016, the International Journal of General Medicine reported that 'Borrelia spirochetes have repeatedly been detected in MD skin and tissue samples.'||The primary species of Borrelia that researchers have encountered throughout multiple studies is Borrelia burgdorferi; a spiral-shaped, bacterial infection transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. This bacteria is known to cause Lyme disease. This may explain why Morgellons and Lyme patients share many of the same symptoms.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Borrelia burgdorferi N40|Borrelia burgdorferi ZS7|Borrelia burgdorferi B31|Borrelia burgdorferi CA382|Borrelia burgdorferi JD1||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
