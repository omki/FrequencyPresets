"Preset_Notes=This preset contains DNA data of micro-organisms associated with neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis.||The onset of neurological problems in humans may be initiated by viral infection within the brain. One virus which is likely to cause neurological problems is Borna disease virus (BDV).||BDV is a slowly replicating, enveloped, negative strand RNA virus that can enter the brain, infect neurons, and remain active and undetected for long periods.||BDV is unique because it replicates in the cell nucleus; other virus types replicate in the cytoplasm.||BDV causes behavioral disturbances in both animals and humans. These disturbances include falling, tremor, abnormal posture, hyperactivity or hypoactivity, increased aggression, and paralysis.||Other viruses such as wild type VSV can rapidly and selectively infect and destroy serotonin (and norepinephrine) neurons, with consequent behavioural brain alterations.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|Borna disease virus 1 strain CL1285/15|Borna disease virus 1 strain CL1286/15|Borna disease virus 1 strain CL1287/15|Borna disease virus 1 strain CL311/15|Borna disease virus 1 strain CL428/15|Borna disease virus 1 strain CL690/15|Borna disease virus 1 strain Horse 1407/15|Borna disease virus 1 strain Horse 271/16|Borna disease virus 1 strain Horse 272/16|Borna disease virus 1 strain Horse 8072/15|Borna disease virus 1 strain SAR313/15|Borna disease virus 1 isolate P4 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 isolate P5 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 isolate recipient#1_02012-13 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 isolate recipient#1_02465 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 isolate recipient#2_02464 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 isolate P8 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 isolate P3 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 isolate P7 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 genomic RNA|Borna disease virus 1 isolate P6 genome assembly: monopartite|Borna disease virus 1 genomic RNA, strain: Bo/04w|Borna disease virus 1 isolate Equ-Cres_DE_1995_CN_2019|Borna disease virus 1 isolate Hu-H2_DE_1994_CN_2019|Borna disease virus 1 strain CRNP5|Borna disease virus 1 strain CRP3A|Borna disease virus 1 strain CRP3B|Borna disease virus 1|Borna disease virus 2|Borna disease virus 2, strain No/98|Borna disease virus 1 genomic RNA, strain: huP2br|Borna disease virus 1 isolate DessVac_DE_1960_CN_2019|Borna disease virus 1, strain H1766|Borna disease virus 1, strain He/80/FR|Borna disease virus 1, strain V/FR|Borna disease virus 1 strain V|Borna disease virus 1|Recombinant vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus rVSV-G/GFP|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate 29705/COL/2001|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus strain T1026R1|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus strain heat-resistant (HR) wild type|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate 28336/COL/1999|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus strain 22-20|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus strain 22-25|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus strain 85CLB|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate DelayedTrans_Anc|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate IN0919COB|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate IN0919WYB1|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate IN0919WYB2|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate V1_24hr|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate V1_48hr|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate V2_24hr|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate V2_48hr|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate V3_24hr|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate V3_48hr|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate V4_24hr|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate V4_48hr|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus isolate VSVwtP0|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus strain Mudd-Summers|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus, genomic RNA, variant popA|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus, genomic RNA, variant popB|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus strain 98COE|Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus strain 94GUB||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
