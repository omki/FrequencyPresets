"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01537/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01326/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01705/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01475/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01711/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01712/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01757/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01744/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01710/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-02105/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-02155/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-02157/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01457/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01638/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-01501/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-02415/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-2507/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3162/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3163/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3170/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3175/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3176/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3181/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3190/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3195/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3230/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3264/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3271/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3279/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3394/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3400/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3831/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-3982/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-4138/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-4189/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-4205/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-4208/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-4475/2020|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-4476/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0003_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0008_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0010_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0012_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0013_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0014_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0015_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0016_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0017_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0018_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0019_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0020_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0021_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0022_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0023_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0024_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0025_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0026_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0027_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0028_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0029_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0030_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0031_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0032_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0033_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0034_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0035_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0036_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0037_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0038_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0039_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0040_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0041_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0042_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0043_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0044_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0045_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0046_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0047_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0048_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0049_CSIR-IGIB/2020|HCoV-19/India/MaxCov0050_CSIR-IGIB/2020||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
