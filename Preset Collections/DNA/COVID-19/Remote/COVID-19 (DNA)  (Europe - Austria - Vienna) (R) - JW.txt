"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0002/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0143/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0146/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0147/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0148/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0149/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0150/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0153/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0154/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0157/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0158/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0159/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0160/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0161/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0162/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0165/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0166/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0167/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0168/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0169/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0170/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0171/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0172/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0175/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0176/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0177/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0178/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0180/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0181/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0182/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0183/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0185/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0188/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0190/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0192/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0193/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0194/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0195/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0196/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0197/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0198/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0199/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0200/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0201/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0204/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0205/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0206/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0209/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0210/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0212/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0213/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0216/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0217/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0218/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0219/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0220/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0221/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0223/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0224/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0225/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0226/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0229/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0230/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0232/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0233/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0238/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0239/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0240/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0241/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0242/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0243/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0244/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0245/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0246/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0247/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0248/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0249/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0250/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0251/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0252/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0254/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0255/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0256/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0257/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0258/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0259/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0260/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0261/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0262/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0263/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0264/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0265/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0269/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0271/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0272/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0273/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0274/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0275/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0277/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0278/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0279/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0280/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0281/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0283/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0284/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0287/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0288/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0294/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0295/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0296/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0357/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0358/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0359/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0360/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0361/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0362/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0363/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0364/2020|HCoV-19/Austria/CeMM0365/2020||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
