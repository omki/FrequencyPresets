"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1255/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1151/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1173/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1055/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S997/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S967/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S998/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1054/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1010/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S968/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S996/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1152/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S251/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S388/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S371/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S387/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S384/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S449/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S382/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S390/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S379/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S389/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S378/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S381/2020'||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
