"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200189/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200191/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200181/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200173/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_6999/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_0024/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_0031/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_0025/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC-CDC-6999/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC-CDC-0034/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200213/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200214/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200215/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200216/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200217/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200219/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200238/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200241/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200242/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200243/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200244/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200245/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200247/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200254/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200255/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200256/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200259/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200264/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200271/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200272/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200278/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200290/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200300/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200306/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200310/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200312/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200323/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200325/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200326/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200331/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200330/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200252/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200253/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200340/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200386/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200459/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200460/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200467/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200468/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200486/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200488/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200222/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200429/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200445/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200446/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200395/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200399/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200401/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NC_200409/2020||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
