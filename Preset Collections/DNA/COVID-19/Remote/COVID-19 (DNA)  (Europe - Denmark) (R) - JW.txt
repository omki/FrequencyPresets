"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Denmark/SSI-101/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/SSI-104/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-101/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-102/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-104/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-106/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-107/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-108/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-110/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-111/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-112/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-113/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-114/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-115/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-116/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-119/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-121/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-122/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-123/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-124/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-125/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-126/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-127/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-128/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-129/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-130/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-131/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-134/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-135/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-136/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-137/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-138/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-139/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-140/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-141/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-142/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-143/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-144/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-145/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-148/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-150/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-151/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-153/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-154/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-155/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-156/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-157/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-158/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-159/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-163/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-165/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-167/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-168/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-169/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-170/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-172/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-173/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-174/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-176/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-177/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-178/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-180/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-181/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-183/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-186/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-187/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-189/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-190/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-191/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-192/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-193/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-194/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-195/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-198/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-199/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-204/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-206/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-207/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-209/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-210/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-211/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-212/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-213/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-218/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-219/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-220/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-221/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-223/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-224/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-227/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-228/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-233/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-235/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-238/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-240/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-241/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-244/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-245/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-246/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-247/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-248/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-249/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-250/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-252/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-254/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-255/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-260/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-262/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-263/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-264/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-265/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-266/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-267/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-97/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-HH-99/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-SSI-763/2020|HCoV-19/Denmark/ALAB-SSI-766/2020||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
