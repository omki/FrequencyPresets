"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following
