"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00113/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00114/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00045/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00048/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00051/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00055/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00057/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00058/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00061/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00064/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00065/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00067/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00118/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00119/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00120/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00017/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00127/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00128/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00129/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00131/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00132/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00133/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00031/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00029/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00039/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00110/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00154/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00158/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00016/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00020/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00023/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00024/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00030/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00036/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00037/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00038/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00041/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00044/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00010/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00015/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00032/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00075/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00076/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00085/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00104/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00033/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00025/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00028/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/MD-HP00078/2020'||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
