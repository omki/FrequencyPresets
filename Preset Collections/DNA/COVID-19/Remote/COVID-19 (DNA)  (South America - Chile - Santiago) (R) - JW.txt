"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago-1/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago-2/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_op2d1/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_op3d1/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_op4d1/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_3/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_4/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_5/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_6/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_7/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_8/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_9/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_10/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_11/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_12/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_13/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_14/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_15/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_16/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_17/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_18/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_19/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_20/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_21/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_22/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_23/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_24/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_25/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_26/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_27/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_28/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_29/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_30/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_31/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_32/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_33/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_34/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_35/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_36/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_37/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_38/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_39/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_40/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_41/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_42/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_43/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_44/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_45/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_46/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_47/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_48/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_49/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_50/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_51/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_52/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_54/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_55/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_56/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_57/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_58/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_59/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_60/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_61/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_62/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_63/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_64/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_65/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_66/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_67/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_68/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_69/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_70/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_71/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_72/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_73/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_74/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_75/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_76/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_77/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_78/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_79/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_80/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_81/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago_53/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/EstacionCentral-26347/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Independencia-27991/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/LaFlorida-26639/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Melipilla-32205/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/PuenteAlto-29192/2020|HCoV-19/Chile/Santiago-25669/2020||Please note that you will have no indication lights on your remote.
