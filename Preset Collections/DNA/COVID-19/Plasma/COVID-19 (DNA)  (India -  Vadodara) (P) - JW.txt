"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC-374a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC-374b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC293a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC290b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC290a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC288/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC289/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC291/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC292a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC292b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC293b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC294/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC295/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC296a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC296b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC297b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC298a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC298b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC299a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC299b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC300a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC300b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC301a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC301b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC302a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC302b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC303a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC303b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC304a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC304b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC305b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC309b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC306a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC306b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC309a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC308/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC307b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC307a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC240/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC241/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC222a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC223a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC224a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC222b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC223b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC224b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC187a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC189/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC216a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC216b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC217a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC217b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC218a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC218b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC175/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC176/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC151a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC151b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC152/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC124/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC125/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC121/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC126/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC127/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC129/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC122/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC128/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC120/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC130/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC123/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC112/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC118/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC117/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC113/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC115/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC110/2020'||Connect OUT 1 to Input.
