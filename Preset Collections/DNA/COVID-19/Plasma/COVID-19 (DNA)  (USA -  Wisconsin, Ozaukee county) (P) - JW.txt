"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-807/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-818/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-821/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-832/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-834/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-941/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-954/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-956/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-957/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-963/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-964/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-399/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-400/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-402/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-403/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-406/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-169/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-174/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-175/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-180/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-194/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-201/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-202/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-203/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-206/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-214/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-220/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-239/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-243/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-244/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-247/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-284/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-295/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-307/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-312/2020'||Connect OUT 1 to Input.
