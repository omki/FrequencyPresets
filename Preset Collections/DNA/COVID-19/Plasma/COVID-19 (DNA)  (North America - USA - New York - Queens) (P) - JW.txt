"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC49/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08404/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08466/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08472/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08474/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08476/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08486/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08487/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08489/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08496/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV08498/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC80/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC89/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC91/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09032/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09037/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09071/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09077/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09080/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09087/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09090/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09092/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09097/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09098/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09099/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC93/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC94/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC99/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC108/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09118/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09125/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09139/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09145/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09161/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09172/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09189/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC133/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC136/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC154/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC157/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC159/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-27073-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC181/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC184/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC187/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC193/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC197/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC190/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC229/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC232/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC238/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC240/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC234/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC251/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC265/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC291/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC296/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC315/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC323/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC333/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC343/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC353/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC361/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC364/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC395/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC396/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC406/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC407/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC425/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC430/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC432/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC436/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC445/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC455/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC456/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC462/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC469/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC485/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC496/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC500/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC504/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC508/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC511/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC514/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC515/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC521/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC535/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC539/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC541/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC542/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC543/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC556/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC559/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC560/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC567/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC572/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC574/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC577/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC583/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC587/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC589/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC590/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC593/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC594/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC597/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC598/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC601/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC602/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC603/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC611/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC617/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC619/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC644/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC647/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC654/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC659/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC664/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09312/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09314/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09315/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09323/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09326/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09334/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09354/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09355/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09357/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09368/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09371/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09375/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09378/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09382/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09428/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09441/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09444/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09446/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09463/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09478/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09480/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09482/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09483/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09485/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09496/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC683/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC684/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC688/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC699/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC706/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC708/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC718/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC721/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC732/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC743/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC748/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC765/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC767/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC774/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC786/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC788/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC802/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC806/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC808/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC811/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC816/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC818/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC830/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC836/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC882/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC883/2020||Connect OUT 1 to Input.
