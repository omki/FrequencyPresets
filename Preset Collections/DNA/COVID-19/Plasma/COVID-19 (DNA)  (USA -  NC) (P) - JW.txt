"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
