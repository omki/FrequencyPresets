"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-17/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-20/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-27/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-49/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-57/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-63/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-65/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-77/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-82/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-118/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-119/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-120/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-131/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-132/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-QDX-151/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00003/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00006/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00010/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00012/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00014/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00015/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00016/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00017/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00019/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00020/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00021/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00022/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00023/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00025/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00028/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00032/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00033/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00290/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-00301/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-CDC-8199/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/UT-CDC-8906/2020'||Connect OUT 1 to Input.
