"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/USA/SEARCH-0007-SAN/2020|HCoV-19/USA/SEARCH-0017-SAN/2020|HCoV-19/USA/SEARCH-0016-SAN/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0175/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0176/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0263/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0262/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0261/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0260/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0259/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0258/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0257/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0256/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0255/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0253/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0252/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0250/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0249/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0248/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0247/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0245/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0244/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0240/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0237/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0236/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0235/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0234/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0233/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0232/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0230/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0228/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0225/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0224/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0223/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0222/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0219/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0218/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0205/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0204/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0201/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0199/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0198/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0197/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0195/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0193/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0192/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0190/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0189/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0188/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0187/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0184/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0182/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0181/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0180/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0179/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0178/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0177/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0094/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0095/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0097/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0098/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0099/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0100/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0103/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0104/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0106/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0107/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0108/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0111/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0113/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0115/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0117/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0118/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0119/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0120/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0122/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0128/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0130/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0132/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0135/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0136/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0217/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0310/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0311/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0312/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0313/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0314/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0341/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0347/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0348/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0349/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0351/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0353/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0355/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0356/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0358/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0359/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0360/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0361/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0362/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0364/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0365/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0366/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0367/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0368/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0369/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0370/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0371/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0372/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0373/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0374/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0376/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0377/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0379/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0381/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0382/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0383/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0385/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0386/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0387/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0388/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0391/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0392/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0395/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0398/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0399/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0401/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0402/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0404/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0405/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0407/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0408/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0409/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0410/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0411/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0412/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0413/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-SR0414/2020||Connect OUT 1 to Input.
