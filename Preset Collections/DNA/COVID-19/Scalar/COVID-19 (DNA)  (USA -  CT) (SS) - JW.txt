"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4237/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6564/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6565/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6569/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6573/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6574/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6576/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5595/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5749/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5754/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5757/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5763/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5764/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5772/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5773/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4343/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4345/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4348/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6259/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6270/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6271/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6314/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6362/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6380/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-6385/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5036/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5038/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5043/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-5073/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4238/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4244/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4251/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4341/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-3845/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-CDC-9849/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4344/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4346/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4347/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4366/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW-4372/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-UW303/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW331/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-UW384/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW256/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CT-UW238/2020'||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
