"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_059/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_084/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_087/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_089/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_156/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_168/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_187/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_196/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_228/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_248/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_252/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_266/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_488/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_492/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_512/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_522/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_569/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/NIC_593/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P001/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P005/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P033/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P037/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1008/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1078/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1088/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1107/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1118/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1132/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P119/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1208/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1267/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1273/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1293/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1317/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1338/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1350/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1415/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1541/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1562/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1655/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1667/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P169/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1957/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P1992/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P209/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2155/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P225/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P226/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P230/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P232/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2355/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2365/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2385/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2447/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2478/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2495/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2498/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2601/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2654/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P269/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2693/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2716/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2717/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P274/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2742/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2763/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2794/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P2800/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P293/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3005/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3045/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3046/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3056/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3059/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3110/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3121/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3124/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3132/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P332/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3343/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P3361/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P338/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P368/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P376/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P460/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P503/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P505/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P515/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P572/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P573/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P574/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P575/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P604/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P629/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P703/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P719/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P729/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P735/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P737/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P769/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P822/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P842/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P858/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P974/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/P979/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/S052/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/S109/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/S299/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/S304/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/S338/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/D5/2020|HCoV-19/Kenya/D6/2020||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
