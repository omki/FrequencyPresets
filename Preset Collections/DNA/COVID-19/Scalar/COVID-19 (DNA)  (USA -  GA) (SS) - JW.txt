"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-232/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-233/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-234/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-239/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-240/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-241/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-242/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-243/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-175/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-177/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-53/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-115/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-116/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-122/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-QDX-152/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2070/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2147/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2275/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-1621/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-1847/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2055/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2118/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2120/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2185/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2343/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-1320/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-1299/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-1445/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2741/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/GA-CDC-2742/2020'||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
