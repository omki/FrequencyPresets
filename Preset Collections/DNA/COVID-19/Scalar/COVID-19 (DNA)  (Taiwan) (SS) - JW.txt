"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-28/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-29/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-30/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-21/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-22/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-23/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-24/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-25/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-26/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-27/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-02/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-06/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-07/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-08/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-09/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-10/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-11/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-12/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-13/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-14/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-15/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-16/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-17/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-18/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-19/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-20/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-03/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-05/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/TWN/CGMH-CGU-01/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020'||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
