"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/USA/CA3/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA4/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA5/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA6/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA7/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA8/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA_2602/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1043/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1044/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1045/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1046/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1047/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1048/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1049/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1050/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1051/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1052/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1053/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1054/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1055/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1056/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1057/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1058/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1059/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1060/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1061/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1062/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1063/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1064/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1065/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1066/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1067/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1068/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1069/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1070/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1071/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1072/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1073/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1074/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1075/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1076/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1077/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1078/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1079/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1080/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1081/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1082/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1083/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1084/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1085/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1086/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1087/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CZB-1088/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-QDX-03/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA_NHRC_01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-CDC-0139/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-QDX-03/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CA-IGI-0045/2020||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
