"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3917/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3919/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3318/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL5472/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL7972/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL4181/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3670/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL5694/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL8580/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL6883/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0052/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3501/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL4069/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL4464/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL5705/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3802/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL5710/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3877/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL1083/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0142/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0178/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL6884/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL2259/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL8751/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0743/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3741/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3680/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3650/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3380/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3575/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL5672/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0539/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL4088/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHLU8150/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL6980/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHLH6415/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL5756/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL5757/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3692/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL1095/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3536/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3695/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL6922/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0977/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3350/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL7513/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3458/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL8539/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0654/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL2653/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL8458/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL7590/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL4232/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0141/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3459/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL1898/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL0976/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL7512/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL3476/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL2223/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL5930/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL2273/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON_PHL2294/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020|HCoV-19|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-01/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-02/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-04/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-010/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-011/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-012/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-016/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-017/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-018/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-021/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-023/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-024/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-025/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-026/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-029/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-030/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-034/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-035/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-036/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-037/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-038/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-039/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-041/2020 |HCoV-19/Canada/QGLO-042/2020 ||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
