"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S2231/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S2143/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1822/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1786/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1785/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1723/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1823/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1724/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1800/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1802/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1638/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1644/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1876/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1647/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1637/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1641/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1787/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1634/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1636/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1801/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1640/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1888/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1635/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1887/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1648/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1642/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1639/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1643/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1409/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1413/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1405/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1449/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1458/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1425/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1375/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S1448/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S992/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA-S989/2020'||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
