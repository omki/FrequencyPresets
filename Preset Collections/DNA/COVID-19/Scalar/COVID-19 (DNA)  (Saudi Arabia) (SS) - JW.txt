"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC01/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC02/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC03/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC07/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC08/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC09/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC10/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC11/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC12/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC13/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC15/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC16/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC17/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC18/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KFSHRC27/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KFSHRC28/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KFSHRC31/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KFSHRC42/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KFSHRC43/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KFSHRC44/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KFSHRC50/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC59/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC60/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC62/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC64/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC67/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC69/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/KAIMRC70/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/477/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/492/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/509/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/518/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/523/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/545/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/553/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/562/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/578/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/583/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/596/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/610/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/627/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/640/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/656/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/671/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/SAU/677/2020'||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
