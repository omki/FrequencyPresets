"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-942/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-11/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-12/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-13/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-14/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-15/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-16/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-18/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-19/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-21/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-22/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-23/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-24/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-250/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-251/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-252/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-253/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-254/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-255/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-257/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-258/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-134/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-20/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-261/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-262/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-263/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-264/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-265/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-266/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-267/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-268/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WI-UW-269/2020'||Connect Spooky Laser directly to Out 1 of your generator.
