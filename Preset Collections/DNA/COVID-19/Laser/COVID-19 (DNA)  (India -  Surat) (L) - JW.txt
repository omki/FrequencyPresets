"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC317/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC323b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC323a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC322a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC320/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC319/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC318b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC318a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC316b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC316a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC265/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC266/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC268a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC268b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC274/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC276/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC275a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC275b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC260b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC261a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC261b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC262/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC263a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC263b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC271a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC271b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC272a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC272b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC270/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC267a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC267b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC259/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC230/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC231a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC231b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC232a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC232b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC211/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC212/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC233a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC236/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC233b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC235a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC235b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC205a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC205b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC206/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC207a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC207b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC208a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC208b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC209a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC209b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC210a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC210b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC214a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC214b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC213a/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC213b/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC10/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC12/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC13/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC14/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/GBRC16/2020'||Connect Spooky Laser directly to Out 1 of your generator.
