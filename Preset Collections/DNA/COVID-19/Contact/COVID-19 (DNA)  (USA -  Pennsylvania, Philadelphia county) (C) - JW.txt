"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/197-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/203-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/209-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/210-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/211-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/211-ETA-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/211-NP-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/211-OP-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/213-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/222-NP-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/222-OP-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/222-OP-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/223-OP-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/227-oropharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/228-nasopharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/228-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/228-oropharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/228-Saliva/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/235-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/237-nasopharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/237-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/237-oropharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/238-nasopharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/239-nasopharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/239-oropharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/240-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/242-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/242-nasopharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/242-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/242-oropharyngeal/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/247-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/251-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/251-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/251-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/256-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/256-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/256-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/257-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/261-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/262-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/263-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/263-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/266-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/266-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/266-NP-OP-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/266-NP-OP-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/269-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/269-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/269-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/272-ETA/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/272-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/272-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/290-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/290-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/307-NP-OP/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CCLB-TCE/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/E6-TCE/2020'||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
