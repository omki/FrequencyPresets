"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4705S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4712V/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4780S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4917S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4936S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4937S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4938S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4944S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4949S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4969S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4970S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4972S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4980S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4983S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4984S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4985S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII4988S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5017V/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5029S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5033S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5047S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5169S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5170S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5244S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5247S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5633S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5634S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5635S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5642S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5643S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5644S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5654S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII5942S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6027S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6031S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6039S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6043S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6053S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6055S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6056S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6060S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6061S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6063S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6065S/2020|HCoV-19/Russia/StPetersburg-RII6086S/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
