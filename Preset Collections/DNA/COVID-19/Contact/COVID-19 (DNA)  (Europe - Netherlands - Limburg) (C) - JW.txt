"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_2/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_3/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_4/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_6/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_5/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_7/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_10/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_8/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_9/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_11/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_12/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_13/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_14/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_15/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_16/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_17/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_18/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_19/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_20/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_21/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_22/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_23/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_24/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_25/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_26/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_27/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_28/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_29/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_30/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_31/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_32/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_33/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_34/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_35/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_36/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_37/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_38/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_39/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_40/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_41/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_42/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_43/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_44/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_45/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_46/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_47/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_48/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_49/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_50/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_51/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_52/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_53/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_54/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_55/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_56/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_59/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_60/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_61/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_62/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_63/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_64/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_66/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_67/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_68/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_69/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_70/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_71/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_72/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_73/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_74/2020|HCoV-19/Netherlands/Limburg_75/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
