"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCov-19/Canada/AG6/2020|HCov-19/Canada/AG1/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/AA7/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/AI8/2020|HCoV-10/Canada/AB5/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AA2/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AA3/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AA6/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AA8/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AA9/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AB1/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AB2/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AB3/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AB4/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AB6/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AB7/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AC1/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AC2/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AC3/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AC5/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AC6/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AC7/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AC8/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AD2/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AD3/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AD4/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AD5/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC_AD8/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00240556/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00240587/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00240652/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00240685/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00240857/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00240954/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00240979/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241026/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241042/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241168/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241192/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241205/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241208/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241245/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241292/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241344/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/Qc-L00241355/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AJ2/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AJ7/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AJ9/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AK2/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AK3/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AK4/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AK7/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AK8/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AL1/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AL2/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AL5/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AL6/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AL7/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AL8/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AL9/2020|HCoV-19/Canada/QC-AM3/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
