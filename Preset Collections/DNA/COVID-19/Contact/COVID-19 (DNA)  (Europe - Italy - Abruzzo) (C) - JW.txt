"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Italy/TE4925/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE4880/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5056/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE4953/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE4959/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE4836/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5052/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5512/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/6193/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6195/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6222/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6225/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5551/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5553/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5674/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5835/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6570/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6571/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6572/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6575/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6577/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6580/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE7859/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE6644/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE12337/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE12759/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE13491/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE13457/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE12774/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE13484/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE13858/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE14297/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE14162/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE14168/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5473/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5541/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5543/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5545/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5547/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5687/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE5827/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE27020/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE26533/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE26539/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE26540/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE26643/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE26969/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE26423/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/TE26425/2020|HCoV-19/Italy/484/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
