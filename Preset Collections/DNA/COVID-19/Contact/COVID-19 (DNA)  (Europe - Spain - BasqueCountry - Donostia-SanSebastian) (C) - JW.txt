"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000958/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000957/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000956/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000955/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000954/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000953/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000950/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000949/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000948/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000947/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000946/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000944/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000943/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000942/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000941/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000940/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000939/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000938/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000937/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000936/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000935/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000934/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000933/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000932/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000931/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000929/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000928/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000927/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000926/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000925/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000924/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000923/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000922/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000920/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000918/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000917/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000915/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000913/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000912/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000911/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000910/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000909/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000908/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000907/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000906/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000905/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000904/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000902/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000901/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000897/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000896/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000895/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000894/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000893/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000892/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000891/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000890/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000888/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000887/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000883/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000882/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000881/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000880/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000879/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000876/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000875/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000874/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000873/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000871/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000869/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000868/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000867/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000866/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000865/2020|HCoV-19/Spain/COV000864/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
