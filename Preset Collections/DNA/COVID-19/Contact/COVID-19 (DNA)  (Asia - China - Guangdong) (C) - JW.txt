"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/Guangdong/20SF201/2020|HCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDFS2020054-P0005/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4373-P0039/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4433-P0040/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4243-P0035/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4475-P0042/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020234-P0023/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020233-P0027/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4448-P0002/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4459-P0041/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4276-P0037/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4273-P0036/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020080-P0010/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020086-P0021/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020087-P0008/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020246-P0028/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDSZ202013-P0014/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDSZ202008-P0020/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDSZ202015-P0019/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/DG-S9-P0045/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/FS-S42-P0046/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/FS-S48-P0047/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/MM-S1-P0048/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/SZ-N59-P0049/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GZ-S6-P0050/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDFS2020127-P0026/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDFS2020052-P0025/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDFS2020056-P0044/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020241-P0013/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020258-P0018/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDSZ202004-P0004/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020227-P0029/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GDSZ202009-P0032/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020139-P0007/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020134-P0031/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020115-P0009/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020016-P0011/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020012-P0022/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/GD2020085-P0043/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4239-P0034/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/2020XN4291-P0038/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/FS-S34-P0015/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/FS-S29-P0051/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/FS-S30-P0052/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/FS-S50-P0053/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/DG-S2-P0054/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/DG-S6-P0055/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/DG-S41-P0056/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/SZ-N128-P0057/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/ZH-S33-P0058/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/ZH-N22-P0059/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/ZS-S6-P0060/2020|HCoV-19/Guangdong/JM-S1-P0062/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
