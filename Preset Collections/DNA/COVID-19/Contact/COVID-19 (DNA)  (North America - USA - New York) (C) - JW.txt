"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/USA/NY1-PV08001/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY2-PV08100/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Yale-030/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Yale-022/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Yale-025/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Yale-026/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC61/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY_2929/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY_1922/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10495-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10496-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10528-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10683-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10690-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10695-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10703-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10704-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10707-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10935-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10955-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10957-02/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10958-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-10999-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11000-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11003-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11017-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11180-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11202-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11284-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11291-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11344-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11353-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11354-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11379-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11380-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-Wadsworth-11666-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC202/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC216/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC268/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC290/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NJ-NYUMC376/2020|HCoV-19/USA/MD-HP041/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC461/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC481/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC482/2020|HCoV-19/USA/CT-Yale-151/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC530/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC635/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC653/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09431/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09436/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09438/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09439/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09484/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-PV09492/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-QDX-01/2020|HCoV-19/USA/NY-NYUMC838/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
