"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0466-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1289-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0495-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0496-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0497-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0500-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0501-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0519-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0521-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0525-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0539-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0547-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0548-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0551-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0552-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0553-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0558-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0567-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0570-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0571-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0577-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0580-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0581-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0588-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0597-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0600-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0602-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0607-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0608-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0610-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0621-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0623-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0624-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0626-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0627-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0628-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0629-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0630-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0631-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0638-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0643-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0645-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0653-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0657-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0658-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0659-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0660-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0661-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0662-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0663-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0667-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0674-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0675-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0678-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0679-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0681-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0724-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0725-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0726-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0728-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0746-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0752-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0753-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0754-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0755-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0756-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0757-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0759-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0760-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0761-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0763-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0765-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0767-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0771-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0778-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0786-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0831-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0834-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0839-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0843-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0845-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0847-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0899-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0902-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0903-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0905-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0907-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0918-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0921-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0923-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0925-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0926-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0930-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0932-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0974-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0997-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-0998-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1015-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1016-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1019-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1021-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1025-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1028-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1032-IPL/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/SEARCH-1035-IPL/2020'||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
