"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/India/NCDC-02336/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC25/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC26/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC48/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC123/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC103/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC104/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC106/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC108/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC110/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC112/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC154/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC156/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC157/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC158/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC159/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC160/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC162/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC163/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC164/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC165/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC166/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC167/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC169/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC170/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC171/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC2/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC20/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC22/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC23/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC24/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC27/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC28/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC30/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC38/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC46/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC47/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC5/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC6/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC7/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC90/2020|HCoV-19/India/RMRC92/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV11165/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV11171/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV11996/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV12742/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV12743/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV12744/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV12752/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV12762/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV13676/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV13678/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV13695/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV13715/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV13744/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV13907/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV13921/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV13929/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV14004/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV14244/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV14262/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV14289/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV14374/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV14743/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV14831/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV14847/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV15546/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV15547/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV15552/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV15907/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV15917/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV15918/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV15937/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16009/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16012/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16280/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16494/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16495/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16498/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16508/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16509/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16510/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16512/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16514/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16631/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16809/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV16828/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV17568/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV17569/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV17741/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV18525/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV18534/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV18539/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV18556/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV19048/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV19144/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV19156/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV19192/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV19209/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV19342/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV19346/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV19355/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20165/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20166/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20407/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20408/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20410/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20557/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20596/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20598/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20600/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV20804/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV21587/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV21602/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV21721/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV24694/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV24917/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV24918/2020|HCoV-19/India/ILSCV27412/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
