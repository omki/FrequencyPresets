"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4254/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4308/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6446/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6448/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6455/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6457/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6466/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6467/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6472/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6473/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4255/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4307/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4354/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4383/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4402/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4418/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-6349/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4547/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4552/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4239/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4266/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-3888/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4486/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-3892/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4100/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-2127/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-2134/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-2160/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-2198/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-2174/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-2255/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4355/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4357/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4375/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4378/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4380/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4396/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4400/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4424/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4427/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4433/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4448/2020'|'SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/ID-UW-4461/2020'||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0 or higher.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
