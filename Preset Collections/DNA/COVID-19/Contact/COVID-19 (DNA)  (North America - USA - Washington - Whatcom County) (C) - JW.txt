"Preset_Notes=This preset can be run normally, or started by pressing 'Scan'. This is useful for programs which contain many frequencies.||By pressing 'Scan', Spooky will perform a quick scan to detect the 10 frequencies which give the strongest response. Spooky will then automatically run those frequencies.||This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for COVID-19. Choose the countries closest to where you live.||Coronaviruses are common, and typically cause mild respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.||Some are more serious - such as the deadly SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).||The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 22nd May, more than 5.1 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, resulting in more than 206,544 deaths.||It seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough and then, after a week, leads to shortness of breath. Loss of the sense of taste and/or smell are also early signs.||In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.||Most victims have been elderly people, suffering from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's and diabetes.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S167/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S168/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S169/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S179/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S180/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S182/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S186/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S188/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S189/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S191/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S192/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S195/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S197/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S198/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S199/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S202/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S203/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S204/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S205/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S206/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S208/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S209/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S216/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S217/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S218/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S220/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S223/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S225/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S226/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S228/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S231/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S332/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S361/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S362/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S363/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S364/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S511/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S521/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S536/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S541/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S562/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S565/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S718/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S744/2020|HCoV-19/USA/WA-S831/2020||Connect your TENS pads or Spooky Hand Cylinders to the 'High Power' port of Spooky Boost v3.0.||Stop treatment if you experience any discomfort."
