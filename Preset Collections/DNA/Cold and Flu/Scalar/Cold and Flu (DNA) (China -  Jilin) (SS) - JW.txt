"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for active viruses which cause the common cold and the flu (influenza). Choose the countries closest to where you live.||The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus.||Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach 'flu' viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'Coxsackievirus A6 isolate Changchun046/CHN/2013'|'Coxsackievirus A6 isolate Changchun097/CHN/2013'|'Coxsackievirus A6 isolate Changchun098/CHN/2013'|'Coxsackievirus A6 isolate Changchun099/CHN/2013'|'Coxsackievirus A16 strain changchun028'|'Coxsackievirus A16 strain changchun029'|'Coxsackievirus A16 strain changchun075'|'Coxsackievirus A16 strain CC024'|'Coxsackievirus A16 strain CC045'|'Coxsackievirus A16 strain CC090'|'Coxsackievirus A16 strain CC097'|'Coxsackievirus A16 strain CC163'||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
