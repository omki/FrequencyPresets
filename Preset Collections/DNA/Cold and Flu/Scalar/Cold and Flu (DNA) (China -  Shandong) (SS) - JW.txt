"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for active viruses which cause the common cold and the flu (influenza). Choose the countries closest to where you live.||The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus.||Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach 'flu' viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'Coxsackievirus A6 strain ZZ177/SD/CHN/2013'|'Coxsackievirus A6 strain BZ034/SD/CHN/2015'|'Coxsackievirus A6 strain DY081/SD/CHN/2015'|'Echovirus E11 strain SD2003-478/SD/CHN/2003'|'Coxsackievirus A16 isolate TA271/Shandong/China/2015'|'Enterovirus A71 isolate SD004R/Shandong/China/2015'|'Human coxsackievirus B1 isolate CVB1SD2011CHN'|'Human coxsackievirus B3 isolate CVB3SD2012CHN'|'Echovirus E6 isolate E6SD11CHN'|'Echovirus E25 isolate E25SD2010CHN'|'Echovirus E30 isolate E30SD2010CHN'||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
