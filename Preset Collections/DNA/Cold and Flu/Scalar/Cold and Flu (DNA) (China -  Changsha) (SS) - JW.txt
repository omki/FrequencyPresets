"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for active viruses which cause the common cold and the flu (influenza). Choose the countries closest to where you live.||The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus.||Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach 'flu' viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/34/2017(H7N9)) segment 1 polymerase PB2 (PB2) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/34/2017(H7N9)) segment 2 polymerase PB1 (PB1) and putative PB1-F2 protein (PB1-F2) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/34/2017(H7N9)) segment 3 polymerase PA (PA) and PA-X protein (PA-X) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/34/2017(H7N9)) segment 4 hemagglutinin (HA) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/34/2017(H7N9)) segment 5 nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/34/2017(H7N9)) segment 6 neuraminidase (NA) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/34/2017(H7N9)) segment 7 matrix protein 2 (M2) and matrix protein 1 (M1) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/34/2017(H7N9)) segment 8 nuclear export protein (NEP) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/50/2017(H7N9)) segment 1 polymerase PB2 (PB2) gene, partial cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/50/2017(H7N9)) segment 2 polymerase PB1 (PB1) and PB1-F2 protein (PB1-F2) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/50/2017(H7N9)) segment 3 polymerase PA (PA) and PA-X protein (PA-X) genes, partial cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/50/2017(H7N9)) segment 4 hemagglutinin (HA) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/50/2017(H7N9)) segment 5 nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/50/2017(H7N9)) segment 6 neuraminidase (NA) gene, partial cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/50/2017(H7N9)) segment 7 matrix protein 2 (M2) and matrix protein 1 (M1) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/50/2017(H7N9)) segment 8 nuclear export protein (NEP) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/72/2017(H7N9)) segment 1 polymerase PB2 (PB2) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/72/2017(H7N9)) segment 2 polymerase PB1 (PB1) and putative PB1-F2 protein (PB1-F2) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/72/2017(H7N9)) segment 3 polymerase PA (PA) and PA-X protein (PA-X) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/72/2017(H7N9)) segment 4 hemagglutinin (HA) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/72/2017(H7N9)) segment 6 neuraminidase (NA) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/72/2017(H7N9)) segment 7 matrix protein 1 (M1) and matrix protein 2 (M2) genes, partial cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/72/2017(H7N9)) segment 8 nuclear export protein (NEP) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/41/2017(H7N9)) segment 1 polymerase PB2 (PB2) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/41/2017(H7N9)) segment 2 polymerase PB1 (PB1) and PB1-F2 protein (PB1-F2) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/41/2017(H7N9)) segment 3 polymerase PA (PA) and PA-X protein (PA-X) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/41/2017(H7N9)) segment 5 nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/44/2017(H7N9)) segment 1 polymerase PB2 (PB2) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/44/2017(H7N9)) segment 2 polymerase PB1 (PB1) and PB1-F2 protein (PB1-F2) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/44/2017(H7N9)) segment 3 polymerase PA (PA) and PA-X protein (PA-X) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/44/2017(H7N9)) segment 5 nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/58/2017(H7N9)) segment 1 polymerase PB2 (PB2) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/58/2017(H7N9)) segment 2 polymerase PB1 (PB1) and PB1-F2 protein (PB1-F2) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/58/2017(H7N9)) segment 3 polymerase PA (PA) and PA-X protein (PA-X) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Changsha/58/2017(H7N9)) segment 5 nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene, complete cds'||Please refer to the Spooky2 Scalar User's Guide for more information."
