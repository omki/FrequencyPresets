"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for active viruses which cause the common cold and the flu (influenza). Choose the countries closest to where you live.||The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus.||Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach 'flu' viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF193002-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF193158-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF266116-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF195004-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF569939-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF473248-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF487798-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF425314-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF572239-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF479745-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF606093-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF551739-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF482253-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF434664-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF425016-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF408680-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF287798-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF408376-FRA-2018'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF307029-FRA-2014'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF270004-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF226028-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF194006-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF241733-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF190038-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF183054-FRA-2016'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate CF125132-FRA-2016'||Connect Spooky Laser directly to Out 1 of your generator.
