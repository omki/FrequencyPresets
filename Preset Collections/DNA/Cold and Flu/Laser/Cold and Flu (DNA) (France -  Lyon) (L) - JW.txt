"Preset_Notes=This preset holds localized, country-specific genome data for active viruses which cause the common cold and the flu (influenza). Choose the countries closest to where you live.||The common cold, also known simply as a cold, is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract that primarily affects the nose. The throat, sinuses, and larynx may also be affected. Signs and symptoms may appear less than two days after exposure to the virus.||Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach 'flu' viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly.||Run this preset for as long as possible. We recommend you also run detox programs in Remote mode.||This preset contains the following strains:|'Enterovirus D68 isolate 14ISO0043'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate 14ISO18022'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate 14ISO0020050'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate 14ISO0120062'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate 16V0908R2'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate 16V1106R2'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate 2123800027'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate VRES189236'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate VRES189536'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate VRES189539'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate VRES189550'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate VRES189560'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate VRES189627'|'Enterovirus D68 isolate VRES189781'|'Influenza A virus (A/Lyon/969/2009(H1N1)) segment 1 polymerase PB2 (PB2) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Lyon/969/2009(H1N1)) segment 2 polymerase PB1 (PB1) gene, complete cds; and nonfunctional PB1-F2 protein (PB1-F2) gene'|'Influenza A virus (A/Lyon/969/2009(H1N1)) segment 3 polymerase PA (PA) and PA-X protein (PA-X) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Lyon/969/2009(H1N1)) segment 5 nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Lyon/969/2009(H1N1)) segment 7 matrix protein 2 (M2) and matrix protein 1 (M1) genes, complete cds'|'Influenza A virus (A/Lyon/969/2009(H1N1)) segment 8 nuclear export protein (NEP) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) genes, complete cds'||Connect Spooky Laser directly to Out 1 of your generator.
