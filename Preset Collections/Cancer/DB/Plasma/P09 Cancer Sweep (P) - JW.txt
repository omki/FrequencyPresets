"Preset_Notes=
Update: March 2020.

This preset runs continuously, and beeps at the end of each loop. Run this preset for at least 1 loop.

This overnight Preset uses a modified Carrier Sweep to target all known pathogens using sidebands. The Carrier is always harmonically related to the Modulation. This directs more energy where it is needed.

Most power is focussed around the Cancer frequencies of 1.604 and 1.607 MHz, but all frequencies are targeted during some point of the sweep.

Place the plasma tube near to, or touching, your body. 
Ensure the plasma tube has free ventilation.

Connect OUT 1 to Input, Out 2 to Modulation."
