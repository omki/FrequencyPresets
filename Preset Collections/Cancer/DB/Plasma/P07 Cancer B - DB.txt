Update: March 2020.

This preset runs continuously, and beeps at the end of each loop. Run this preset for at least 1 loop.

There are many different types of cancer, and programs to deal with these range from three minutes to 201 minutes in length. Since we cannot know what type of cancer you're dealing with, we've embedded a 201-minute placeholder named 'Your Cancer Type CUST' here.

You must replace this, together with 'Your Cancer Scan Results CUST' and 'Your System Scan Results CUST,' with a program or programs for your cancer type, and substitute your own scan results programs as appropriate. The three programs which must be replaced by you are indented in the list below.

Instructions are provided in the protocol Guide.

This means that the run time of this preset depends on the program choice you make for your cancer type. As a result, provision of Step numbers is not possible.

PROGRAMS:
   Your System Scan Results CUST
   Your Cancer Scan Results CUST
   Your Cancer Type CUST

Cancer Viruses CUST
Cancer Cell Cytoskeleton XTRA
Cancer Cell Repair CUST
Lymphocytes Stimulate XTRA
Leukocytogenesis Stimulate XTRA
Immune System Stimulation 3 PROV

Connect OUT 1 to Input, Out 2 to Modulation."
