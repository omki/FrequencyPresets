This preset runs continuously, and beeps at the end of each loop. Run this preset for at least 1 loop.

Dr. Hulda Clark found that most pain in cancer cases is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, also called Diplococcus pneumoniae. Dr. Richard Loyd has reported that many sufferers are able to forego pain medication after dealing with this.

IMPORTANT: this preset kills pathogens, and runs twice. Use ALL Detox (R) - DB on another generator while running this.
