Update: March 2020.

Spooky Coil converts the signals from the XM generator to a magnetic field. Any frequency or waveform can be used.

There are many different types of cancer, and programs to deal with these range from three minutes to 201 minutes in length. Since we cannot know what type of cancer you're dealing with, we've embedded a 201-minutes placeholder named 'Your Cancer Type CUST' here.

You must replace this, together with 'Your Cancer Scan Results CUST' and 'Your System Scan Results CUST,' with a program or programs for your cancer type, and substitute your own scan results programs as appropriate. The three programs which must be replaced by you are indented in the list below.

Instructions are provided in the protocol Guide.

This means that the run time of this preset depends on the program choice you make for your cancer type. As a result, provision of Step numbers is not possible.

Connect Spooky PEMF Coil to the generator, using Spooky Boost for best results. The side marked 'BN' should be placed against your skin.

This preset runs continuously, and beeps at the end of each loop. Run this preset for at least 1 loop.
