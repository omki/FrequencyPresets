Update: March 2020.

Spooky Coil converts the signals from the XM generator to a magnetic field. Any frequency or waveform can be used.

Connect Spooky PEMF Coil to the generator, using Spooky Boost for best results. The side marked 'BN' should be placed against your skin.

This preset runs continuously, and beeps at the end of each loop. Run this preset for at least 1 loop.

IMPORTANT: this preset kills pathogens. Use ALL Detox (R) - DB on another generator while running this. Use as required, for as long as necessary.
