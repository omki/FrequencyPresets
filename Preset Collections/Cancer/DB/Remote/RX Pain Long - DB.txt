Update: November 2016.

Dr. Hulda Clark found that most pain in cancer cases is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, also called Diplococcus pneumoniae. Dr. Richard Loyd has reported that many sufferers are able to forego pain medication after dealing with this. Use as required, for as long as necessary.

IMPORTANT: this preset kills pathogens. Use ALL Detox (R) - DB on another generator while running this.

PROGRAMS:
Diplococcus Pneumoniae_1 HC
Streptococcus Pneumoniae HC
Pneumococcus CAFL
Diplococcus Pneumoniae 1 XTRA

The Preset has been designed to loop continuously until stopped.

Connect your Spooky Remote to the 'BN' port of Spooky Boost, or to the Out 1 port of your generator if you don't have Spooky Boost."
