The original Rife frequencies and a modern DNA frequency are transmitted over an extended duration.

A slow 10% duty cycle gate on the Modulation input provides strong signal spikes.

Best used with a phanotron tube. 

Do not alter the Frequency Multiplier, Frequency Limit, waveforms or other settings of this preset. Doing so may render it inoperative.

Connect OUT 1 to Input. Out 2 to Modulation."
