"Preset_Notes=Chlamydia Plasma preset. By Manuel Mallo

Chlamydia is another dangerous bacteria. Very difficult to get rid of. I hope the method of attacking the integrity of its DNA will render good results.

It has included all the known strains of this bacteria, including the pneumoniae one. 

The preset for Plasma mode has a number of steps, in order to be stopped when neccessary, allowing it to be resumed from the same point.

You can run detox sets on another generator 24/7. Proper hydration is a must.

Place the plasma tube near to, or touching, your body. Ensure the plasma tube has free ventilation.

Connect OUT 1 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Input. Out 2 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Modulation."
