"Preset_Notes=Human Herpesvirus 1 Plasma preset. By Manuel Mallo

Human Herpesvirus 1 is apparently only an annoying virus producing cold sores.

The truth is, as all the neuroinvasive virus, this little bug has an active role helping other micro-organisms to attack us.

They hide inside the nerves, and remains there forever. From time to time, when our immune system is down, it takes advantage of that, and produces the visible cold sore.

Meanwhile, while apparently in sleep mode, it is degradating our nerve system, and now it is linked to a variety of neurological diseases.

Besides that, all herpesvirus types can collaborate, helping each other to produce more harm.

I intend to create presets for all the herpesvirus types, because its active role degrading our health.

This preset comprises all the 23 known strains of this creature.

As the dwell time is not very long, plasma and contact modes are recommended. 

You can run detox sets on another generator 24/7. Proper hydration is a must.

Place the plasma tube near to, or touching, your body. Ensure the plasma tube has free ventilation.

Connect Out 1 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Input. Out 2 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Modulation."
