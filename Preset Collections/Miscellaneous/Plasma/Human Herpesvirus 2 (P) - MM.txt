"Preset_Notes=Human Herpesvirus 2 Plasma preset. By Manuel Mallo

I have prepared a preset for Human Herpesvirus 2, also known as genital herpes.

This preset comprises all the 10 known strains of this creature.

As the dwell time is not very long, plasma and contact modes are recommended. Remote mode must be run nonstop for almost a week to see results.

This virus tend to reside in the sacral ganglia, so, you can expect some discomfort in the area.

It is estimated that about 80% of adult people have the HHV1 or HHV2, proving how efficient in spreading they are.

You can run detox sets on another generator 24/7. Proper hydration is a must.

Place the plasma tube near to, or touching, your body. Ensure the plasma tube has free ventilation.

Connect Out 1 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Input. Out 2 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Modulation."
