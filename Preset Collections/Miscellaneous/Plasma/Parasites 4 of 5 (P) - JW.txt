"Preset_Notes=Overnight Preset for Spooky Plasma. Part 4 of 5.

Independent lab results have verified the effectiveness of this set of Presets, with a full reduction of parasite burden in 2 patients after cycling through several times.

Each parasite killing preset should be run for two consecutive nights before advancing to the next stage. After the 10th night, repeat the entire cycle if necessary.

Place the plasma tube near to, or touching, your body. 
Ensure the plasma tube has free ventilation.

Connect OUT 1 to Spooky Plasma Input. Out 2 to Spooky Plasma Modulation."
