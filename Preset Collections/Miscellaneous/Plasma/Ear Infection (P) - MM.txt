"Preset_Notes=Ear Infection Plasma preset. By Manuel Mallo

Ear infections are caused mainly by Strep Pneumoniae, so this preset focuses on that pathogen.

As the fluid pressure buildup could cause the eardrum rupture, better if an MD diagnoses the issue.

You can run detox sets on another generator 24/7. Proper hydration is a must.

Place the plasma tube near to, or touching, your body. Ensure the plasma tube has free ventilation.

Connect OUT 1 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Input. Out 2 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Modulation.

Use at your own risk."
