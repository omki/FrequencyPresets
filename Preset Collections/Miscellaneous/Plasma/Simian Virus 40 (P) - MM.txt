"Preset_Notes=Simian Virus 40 Plasma preset. By Manuel Mallo

This preset is for a deadly creature, the Simian Virus 40. I have processed the 35 known strains of its DNA to create a one and a half hour program.

This pathogen is involved in several types of cancer, as breast cancer, osteosarcomas, brain tumors, etc.

Sadly, the discovery of SV40 revealed that between 1955 and 1963 around 90% of children and 60% of adults in USA were inoculated with SV40-contaminated polio vaccines.

Ideally, the plasma preset could be used once a day. Same thing with the contact mode one. The remote mode one could be run 24/7.

Contact and remote modes uses the boost device to combine the outputs to generate two harmonics that serve to target the high frequency of the MOR when combined.

Carefully write down the frequencies that cause discomfort or herxs, to be prepared to insist on them, if necessary.

You can run detox sets on another generator 24/7. Proper hydration is a must.

Place the plasma tube near to, or touching, your body. Ensure the plasma tube has free ventilation.

Connect Out 1 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Input. Out 2 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Modulation."
