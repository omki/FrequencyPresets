It makes perfect sense, so I have prepared two presets for this lethal creature.

The first one runs for 192 hours (8 days), so it is for remote mode only. Staphylococcus Aureus Stepped Sweep(R) - MM.

The second one is for the plasmids inside the bug, and runs for 45 minutes, so I have prepared a preset for contact mode, remote mode, and also for plasma.
Staphylococcus Aureus Plasmids presets.

The first preset also covers the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), so it would also be helpful for people not suffering only from diabetes2.

I have noticed several herxs as the program progresses, so when this happens, write down the program step so you can repeat it, if necessary.
The programs are a bit long, but definitely they worth the time to complete them.

You can run detox sets on another generator 24/7. Proper hydration is a must.

Place the plasma tube near to, or touching, your body. Ensure the plasma tube has free ventilation.

Connect Out 1 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Input. Out 2 to Spooky Plasma/Spooky Plasma Modulation."
