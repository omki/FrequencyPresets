"Preset_Notes=This is a 'Shell Preset' for Spooky Cold Laser.

Spooky Cold Laser has adapter cables that plug directly into your Spooky2 generator.

There are currently 2 versions of Spooky Cold Laser:

1. Spooky Cold Laser Wrist with 5 x 5mW 650nm lasers providing healing frequencies directly to your blood and carpal tunnel.

2. Spooky Cold Laser Twin with 2 x 7mW 650nm lasers for ear, nasal, navel or acupuncture use. This model comes with 2 spare silicon covers.

Cold Laser Therapy, or Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a treatment that uses a precise specific wavelength of light to interact with tissue. This helps to accelerate the body’s natural healing process. People who suffer from a variety of acute and chronic conditions can use Cold Laser Therapy to help eliminate pain, swelling, reduce spasms and increase functionality.

Cold lasers are low power lasers which provide non-thermal photons of light. These photons pass through the dermis, epidermis, and the subcutaneous tissue or tissue fat under the skin. They are often used for up to 30 minutes at a time, though longer treatment durations cause no adverse effects.

The light energy is absorbed and interacts with the light sensitive elements within the cell. This process is very similar to photosynthesis in plants. Sunlight is absorbed by plants, which is then converted to energy for the plant to grow. 

The light energy absorbed by cells allows each cell to 'normalize'. This increasing intracellular metabolism results in a reduction in pain, inflammation, edema and reduced healing time. Photons absorbed by the cells through laser therapy stimulate the mitochondria to accelerate production of ATP. This biochemical increase in cell energy is used to transform live cells from a state of illness to a stable, healthy state. 

Cold laser therapy can stimulate most cell types, including muscle, ligament, cartilage, nerves, and many more. Cold laser therapy is useful for:
•	Bone regeneration
•	Carpal tunnel syndrome
•	Colorectal cancer
•	Dental pain
•	Dentin hypersensitivity
•	Elbow disorders
•	Fibromyalgia
•	Herpes labialis
•	Knee osteoarthritis
•	Lymphedema
•	Musculoskeletal dysfunction
•	Myofascial pain syndrome
•	Neurological dysfunctions,
•	Pain relief (e.g. acute and chronic low back pain/neck pain, orthodontic pain, shoulder pain)
•	Patella-femoral pain syndrome
•	Physical therapy (including rehabilitation following carpal tunnel release)
•	Recurrent aphthous stomatitis/ulcers
•	Rheumatoid arthritis
•	Shoulder impingement syndrome
•	Temporomandibular joint disorders
•	Tinnitus
•	Wound healing
	
Physicians have been using cold laser therapy for over 40 years on patients who are seeking effective, alternative methods for pain relief. Over 2,500 clinical studies published worldwide since 1967. Most of these studies were double-blinded and placebo-controlled. They clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of cold laser therapy for pain relief.

The Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010 Task Force on Neck Pain reviewed the effectiveness of cold laser therapy for neck pain. The review concluded that low-level laser therapy is a valuable treatment for many conditions.

Several treatments may be required before any improvement is observed. Old injuries may initially become irritated during the initial stages of treatment.

Connect Spooky Laser directly to Out 1 of your generator. Do not use a boosted output.

As with all laser products, do not shine the light directly into your eyes. Use the protection glasses provided.
